    <i>Breaking the doomscrolling cycle with Contre Sozial.</i>
</p>

### Description

Contre Sozial tries to eliminate the biggest problem in social media networks, that is, doomscrolling using the power of machine learning algorithms.

#### Stratagem
1. Record a series of scroll events.
2. Train a machine learning model to predict a set of the scroll event patterns.
3. Detect foreground running overlay activities simultaneously ([Current Activity - android-TopActivity](https://github.com/109021017/android-TopActivity))
